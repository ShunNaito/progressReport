Unidirectional and bidirectional partner selection mechanisms are introduced and compared to controls with random partner rematching. Results demonstrate significantly higher contributions in correspondence to unidirectional Partner selection than to bidirectional selection and random rematching.  Average monetary valuation of being able to choose a partner is substantially high and remains stable.",

Rational and selfish plyers will recognize they can free ride on the successful contributions of oters. If the effort is not successful, they will lose a contribution -- and be ``suckered.'' Other than relying on altruism, organizers of the group effort can modify incentives so that players are more prepared to contribute. Laboratory experiments offer one way of assessing the effectiveness of various such modifications: we conducted such tests to see how well contibuting is promoted by (1) assuring contributors that they will not lose if the group effort fails (a ``money-back garantee'') and (2) enforcing contributions if it succeeds (``fair share''). We expect the latter to be more successful because it is ``stable,'' unlike the former, whose success can be undermined by expectaions of that success. Three experimental repl!
 ic!
ations demonstrate that the money-back guarantee is no more successful than a standard dilemma, but fair-share requirements increase contributing significantly over that base. Analysis of subjects' expectations about others' behavior offers some support to the hypothesized process undermining the money-back gurantee, but motivational factors must also be taken into account for a full explanation.",

Two theories offer contradictory predictions for equal and unequal power situations. Bilateral deterrence theory predicts that when actors habe equal power, higher lebels of coercive capability will reduce the frequency will increase the frequency of punitive tactics. Comparing equal with unequal power relationships, bilateral deterrence predicts further that actors will use more punitive tactics under conditions of unequal power, while conflict spiral predicts that they will use fewer barganing setting which manipulated the magnitude of coercive power available to actors and which allowed them to exchange offers and administer threats and punishments to one another. The results of two experiments support bilateral deterrence theory and generally contradict conflict spiral theory.",

When cooperators are relatively more willing to play, they will interact more frequently with each other and their payoff per encounter will be higher --potentially higher than that of intending defectors. Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optinal entry will increase social welfare. We report laboratory data showing: (1) Social welfare and the relative walfare of intending cooperators are higher when subjects are free to choose betweenentering and not entering paticular Prisoner's Dilemma relationships; and (2) this difference is a consequence of intending cooperators' greater willingness to enter such relationships, not because of any capacity to recognize and avoid intending defectors.

A summary and analysis of many investigations lead to the following conclusions applicable to the popluration studied: People who trust more are less likely to lie and are possibly less likely to cheat or steal. They are more likely to give others a second chance and to respect the rights of oters. The high truster is less likely to be unhappy, conflicted, or  maladjusted, and is liked more and sought out as a friend more often, both by low-trusting and high-trusting oters. When gullibility is defined as naivete or foolishness and trust is defined as believing others in the obsence of clear-cut  reasons to disbelieve, then it can be shown ober a series of studies that high trustes are not more gullible than low trusters.",

False-name bids are bids submitted by a single bidder using multiple identifiers such as multiple e-mail addresses. The obtained results are summarized as follows: (1) the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is strategy-proof and Pareto efficient when there exists no false-name bid, is not false- name-proof; (2) there exists no false-name-proof conminatorial auction protocol that satisfies Pareto efficiency; (3) one sufficient condition where the VCG mechanism is false-name-proof is identified, i.e., the concavity of a surplus function over bidders.",
